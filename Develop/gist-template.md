# Title (replace with your title)
As a developer, I want to create a tutorial that explains how a specific regular expression, or regex, functions by breaking down each part of the expression and describing what it does.

## Summary
A Regex or regular expression is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings. It also looks for input validations. It is a technique commonly developed in theoretical computer science.

We will look a a string of code using regex, this code looks for a match HTML tag.
```
/^<([a-z]+)([^<]+)*(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)$/
```

## Regex Components

### Anchors
* `^abc$`	-^start / $end of the string
    * `^` Matches the beginning of the string, or the beginning of a line if the multiline flag (m) is enabled.This matches a position, not a character.
    * `$` Matches the end of the string, or the end of a line if the multiline flag (m) is enabled. This matches a position, not a character.

* `\b\B`	-word, not-word boundary
    * `\b` Matches a word boundary position between a word character and non-word character or position (start / end of string). See the word character class (w) for more info.
    * `\B` Matches any position that is not a word boundary. This matches a position, not a character.
    * See Boundaries for more detailed Information

### Quantifiers
* `a*a+a?`	-0 or more, 1 or more, 0 or 1
    * "+" Matches 1 or more of the preceding token.
    * "*" Matches 0 or more of the preceding token.
    * "?" Matches 0 or 1 of the preceding token, effectively making it optional.
    * "?" Makes the preceding quantifier lazy, causing it to match as few characters as possible. By default, quantifiers are greedy, and will match as many characters as possible.

* `a{5}a{2,}`	 -Looks for exactly five, two or more
* `{2,6}`  	    -forces the input of characters between two & six characters long.
* `a+?a{2,}?`	 -match as few as possible
* `ab|cd`	    -match ab or cd
